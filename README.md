## A build from scratch forum website

Currently running on https://forum-react-redux.herokuapp.com . This project is to keep my skills up and learn new things, also to showcase what I can do. 

you can create an account(currently without email verification), make a profile ( upload a profile picture  ), post articles and replies to them, and send messages to other users.

Uses React-Redux and communicates with an Express backend ( see here https://github.com/Doperwt/forum-api ) which uses MongoDB . Stores user data securely using JWT and passport. 

planned features are:
* more information on articles
* chat room
* games for in chat rooms
